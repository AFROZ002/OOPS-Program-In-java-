In Java, access modifiers define the visibility and accessibility of classes, methods, variables, and other members within a program.

Public: Members declared as public are accessible from any class or package. There are no access restrictions.

Private: Members declared as private are accessible only within the same class. They are not visible to other classes.

Protected: Members declared as protected are accessible within the same class, subclasses, and classes in the same package.

Default (Package-Private): Members with no explicit modifier (i.e., no public, private, or protected keyword) are accessible within the same package but not outside it.

These access modifiers control the encapsulation level, ensuring data hiding and access control, crucial for building robust and secure Java applications
